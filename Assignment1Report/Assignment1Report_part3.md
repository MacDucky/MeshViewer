###6. camera rotation
we did not have enough time to implement camera rotations 


###7.Camera LookAt:
We can see that the camera is located somewhere on axis X but the LookAt is aimed on the location of the model, explaining why we see it from the side:

###8. Multiple models and cameras
we did not have enough time to implement camera rendering, but we can switch between multiple cameras easily

###9. Resized window maintains the ratio aspect
we did not have enough time to implement the ratio aspect maintaining


###10. GUI

###11. Additional Features
we did not really had enough time to implement an additional feature, only added the option to resize the normal length
